Sync Gateway is REST API server that allows Couchbase Lite mobile databases to synchronize data. It can also be used as a standalone data storage system.

For more information, see the [Couchbase Mobile Overview](http://developer.couchbase.com/mobile).

## Quickstart

```
$ docker run -p 4984:4984 -d couchbase/sync-gateway
```

At this point you should be able to run a curl request against the running Sync Gateway on the port 4984 public port:

```
$ curl http://localhost:4984

{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":1.3},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/1.3.0(274;8c3ee28)"}
```

> **Note:** if you are running on OSX using docker-machine, you will need to use the IP address of the running docker machine rather than localhost (eg, http://192.168.99.100)

You can view the Sync Gateway logs via the `docker logs` command:

```
$ docker logs container-id
2016-08-04T17:53:44.513Z Enabling logging: [HTTP+]
2016-08-04T17:53:44.513Z ==== Couchbase Sync Gateway/1.3.0(274;8c3ee28) ====
2016-08-04T17:53:44.513Z requestedSoftFDLimit < currentSoftFdLimit (5000 < 1048576) no action needed
etc ...
```

> **Note:** replace `container-id` above with the actual running container id (ie, `9d004a24a4d1`), which you can find by running `docker ps | grep sync_gateway`.

## Accessing the Sync Gateway Admin port from the container

By default, the port 4985, which is the Sync Gateway Admin port, is only accessible via localhost. This means that it's only accessible *from within the container*.

To access it from within the container, you can get a bash shell on the running container and then use curl to connect to the admin port as follows:

```
$ docker exec -ti container-id bash
```

> **Note:** replace `container-id` above with the actual running container id (ie, `9d004a24a4d1`), which you can find by running `docker ps | grep sync_gateway`.

From the container shell (indicated by the `#` prompt), you can use `curl` to make requests against the running Sync Gateway by running:

```
# curl http://localhost:4985

{"ADMIN":true,"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":1.3},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/1.3.0(274;8c3ee28)"}
```

## Exposing accessing to the SyncGateway Admin port to the host

If you need to expose port 4985 to the host machine, you can do so with the following steps.

You may want to stop any currently running Sync Gateway containers with `docker stop container-id`.

Start a container with these arguments:

```
$ docker run -p 4984-4985:4984-4985 -d couchbase/sync-gateway -adminInterface :4985 /etc/sync_gateway/config.json
```

Now, from the *host* machine, you should be able to run a curl request against the admin port of 4985:

```
$ curl http://localhost:4985

{"ADMIN":true,"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":1.3},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/1.3.0(274;8c3ee28)"}
```

> **Note:** if you are running on OSX using docker-machine, you will need to use the IP address of the running docker machine rather than localhost (eg, http://192.168.99.100)

## Customizing Sync Gateway configuration

### Using a Docker volume

Prepare the Sync Gateway configuration file on your local machine:

```
$ cd /tmp
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/master/examples/basic-walrus-bucket.json
$ mv basic-walrus-bucket.json my-sg-config.json
$ vi my-sg-config.json  # make edits
```

Run Sync Gateway and use that configuration file:

```
$ docker run -p 4984:4984 -d -v /tmp:/tmp/config couchbase/sync-gateway /tmp/config/my-sg-config.json
```

> **Note:** If you are running on OSX using docker-machine, you will need to either use a directory under `/Users` instead of `/tmp`, or run `docker-machine ssh` and run the commands from within the docker-machine Linux VM.

### Using a URL

Sync Gateway can also load it's configuration directly from a URL.

First upload a configuration file to a publicly available hosting site of your choice (Amazon S3, Github, etc)

Then start Sync Gateway and give it the URL to the raw JSON data:

```
$ docker run -p 4984:4984 -d couchbase/sync-gateway https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/master/examples/basic-walrus-bucket.json
```

## Using a volume to persist data across container instances

Sync Gateway uses an in-memory storage backend by default, called [Walrus](https://www.ihasabucket.com/), which has the ability to store snapshots of it's memory contents to disk. *This should never be used in production*, and is included for development purposes.

The default configuration file used by the Sync Gateway Docker container saves Walrus memory snapshots of it's data in the `/opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/data` directory inside the container.  If you want to persist this data *across container instances*, you just need to launch the container with a volume that mounts a local directory on your host, for example, your `/tmp` directory.

```
$ docker run -p 4984:4984 -v /tmp:/opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/data -d couchbase/sync-gateway
```

You can verify it worked by looking in your `/tmp` directory on your host, and you will see a `.walrus` memory snapshot file.

```
$ ls /tmp/*.walrus

db.walrus
```

> **Note:** if you are running on OSX using docker-machine, you will need to either use a directory under `/User` instead of `/tmp`, or run `docker-machine ssh` and run the commands from within the docker-machine Linux VM.

If you add data to a Sync Gateway in a container instance, then stop that container instance and start a new one and mount the volume where the memory snapshots were stored, you should see data from the earlier container instance.

> **WARNING:** if you have multiple container instances trying to write memory snapshots to the same files on the same volumes, it will corrupt the memory snapshots.

## Running with Couchbase Server

Create a docker network called `couchbase`.

```
$ docker network create --driver bridge couchbase
```

Run Couchbase Server in a docker container, and put it in the `couchbase` network.

```
$ docker run --net=couchbase -d --name couchbase-server -p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 couchbase
```

Now go to the Couchbase Server Admin UI on [http://localhost:8091](http://localhost:8091) (on OSX, replace localhost with the docker machine host IP) and go through the Setup Wizard.  See [Couchbase Server on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/couchbase/server/) for more info.

Create a `/tmp/my-sg-config.json` file on your host machine, with the following:

```
{
  "log": ["*"],
  "databases": {
    "db": {
      "server": "http://couchbase-server:8091",
      "bucket": "default",
      "users": { "GUEST": { "disabled": false, "admin_channels": ["*"] } }
    }
  }
}
```

Start a Sync Gateway container in the `couchbase` network and use the `/tmp/my-sg-config.json` file:

```
$ docker run --net=couchbase -p 4984:4984 -v /tmp:/tmp/config -d couchbase/sync-gateway /tmp/config/my-sg-config.json
```

Verify that Sync Gateway started by running `docker logs container-id` and trying to run a curl request against it:

```
$ curl http://localhost:4984
```

## Using sgcollect_info

This section only applies if you need to run the `sgcollect_info` tool to collect Sync Gateway diagnostics for Sync Gateway running in a docker container. In order to collect the logs you will need to do the following workaround:

```
$ docker logs container-id > /tmp/sync_gateway.log 2>&1
$ docker exec container-id mkdir -p /var/log/sync_gateway/
$ docker cp /tmp/sync_gateway.log contaner-id:/var/log/sync_gateway/sync_gateway_error.log
```

Once that is done, you can run `sgcollect_info` via:

```
$ docker exec container-id /opt/couchbase-sync-gateway/tools/sgcollect_info --help
```
