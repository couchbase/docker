The Couchbase Autonomous Operator makes the easiest to manage data platform even easier by providing native Kubernetes integration with Couchbase. It automates administrative tasks and operational best practices while maintaining full data platform capabilities from within and across clouds and on-premises deployments.

Couchbase Autonomous Operator extends the Kubernetes API to create, configure and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user. It builds upon the basic Kubernetes resource and controller concepts, but also includes domain an application-specific knowledge to automate common tasks better managed by computers.
